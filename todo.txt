Hiccup, a Viking, must kill a dragon to mark his passage into manhood and be initiated into his tribe. However, he ends up doing the exact opposite by befriending a deadly dragon, Night Fury.

pagemanager manager (pmm)
It is a fyne.io application.
It can browse the list of registered plugins at pagemanager.org.
It can automatically download go and git on the user's system.
It can recompile the user's main.go and import.go to produce a runnable binary.
It can run the pagemanager binary and manage its lifecycle (start up, shut down).
If no SQL dsn is provided, it falls back to spinning up an SQLite database in the data directory.
